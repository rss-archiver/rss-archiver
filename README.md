# RSS-Archiver
RSS-Archiver is made to facilitate continuous archival of different sources exposing an rss feed. 
It's made to be expandable using docker-compose and a standard API for which you can find the spec 
[here](https://github.com/rss-archiver/rss-archiver/blob/main/openapi.json).
As an example, you can look at https://github.com/rss-archiver/rss-archiver/tree/main/html, 
https://github.com/rss-archiver/rss-archiver/tree/main/rss is the host for the application.

I plan on providing multiple services using different repositories under this organisation.
